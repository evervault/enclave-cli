# Cages CLI

Command Line Tool to build, deploy and manage Evervault [Cages](https://github.com/evervault/cages/)

## Notice on Open Source Status of this project
The Evervault Cages product is open source with the aim of providing transparency to users â€” this is vital given that our process runs in the enclave, and is accounted for in the attestation.

The current state of this project does not allow for self-hosting. We plan on addressing this by abstracting away the Evervault-specific elements of the Cages product.

## Try out Reproducible Builds

Reproducible builds will stay in the experimental phase until the release of Buildkit v0.12 which is expected in the next few weeks.

We have implemented the work arounds for reproducible builds from this [blog post](https://medium.com/nttlabs/bit-for-bit-reproducible-builds-with-dockerfile-7cc2b9faed9f). These workout arounds won't be needed in v0.12 so we are going to wait till then to merge the feature into the CLI.

To try out the feature now:
```
cargo build --features repro_builds
sudo ln -s ${PROJECT_DIR}/target/debug/ev-cage /usr/local/bin/ev-cage
```

Build a Cage:
```
ev-cage init --name test-repro-builds
ev-cage build
```

Reproduce the same Cage anywhere:
```
ev-cage build --from-existing enclave.Dockerfile
```
